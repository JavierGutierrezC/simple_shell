# Simple shell project
> Create a shell user interface

## shell
* This project is about making a custom prototype of the shell

## Description in a nutshell
* The shell is an interactive user interface with an operating system. In this case, itÂ´s a Command-Line Interface (CLI). It takes commands from the user and executes them.

## Description in deep
* A command-line interface (CLI) is an operating system shell that uses alphanumeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data to the operating system, interactively. For example, many command-line shells has the ability to save sequences of commands for re-use. A data file can contain sequences of commands which the CLI can be made to follow as if typed in by a user. Special features in the CLI may apply when it is carrying out these stored instructions. Such batch files (script files) can be used repeatedly to automate routine operations such as initializing a set of programs when a system is restarted. Batch mode use of shells usually involves structures, conditionals, variables, and other elements of programming languages; some have the bare essentials needed for such a purpose, others are very sophisticated programming languages in and of themselves. Conversely, some programming languages can be used interactively from an operating system shell or in a purpose-built program.

The shell breaks the input into tokens: words and operators; see Token Recognition.

The shell parses the input into simple commands (see Simple Commands) and compound commands (see Compound Commands).

The shell performs various expansions (separately) on different parts of each command, resulting in a list of pathnames and fields to be treated as a command and arguments; see Word Expansions.

The shell performs redirection (see Redirection) and removes redirection operators and their operands from the parameter list.

The shell executes a function (see Function Definition Command), built-in (see Special Built-In Utilities), executable file, or script, giving the names of the arguments as positional parameters numbered 1 to n, and the name of the command (or in the case of a function within a script, the name of the script) as the positional parameter numbered 0 (see Command Search and Execution).

The shell optionally waits for the command to complete and collects the exit status (see Exit Status for Commands).

Our operational commands
```SHELL
ls - list directory contents
pwd - print name of current/working directory

(For more information search the man pages of each command)
```

## Example
### Clone repo using HTTPS
``` $ git clone https://github.com/JavierGutierrezC/simple_shell.git ```

### Compilation
You can compile the files using this command:
``` $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh ```
