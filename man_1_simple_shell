.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.I [command string] [arguments ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh or the shell utility is a command language interpreter that shall execute commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file. The application shall ensure that the commands to be executed are expressed in the language described in Shell Command Language.
.SH Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
The shell incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.
.SH commands:
.PP
ls - list directory contents
.PP
pwd - print name of current/working directory
.PP
exit - cause normal process termination
.SH EXAMPLE
type and enter ./hsh for execute shell then try typing ls inside of the shell and hit enter, it should enlist all the files in the current directory 
.SH REPORTING BUGS
